## Logging and Provenance

The `log` command in Nextflow can provide valuable information about a pipeline execution. This information can be used to track the provenance of a workflow result.

To fetch the list of run names or session IDs, the `nextflow log` command can be utilized:

```bash
nextflow log
```

This command will produce a summary of the executions log and runtime information for all executed pipelines. The summary includes date and time of the run, duration, run name, run status, a revision ID, the session id, and the command executed on the command line.

To get more detailed information about an individual run, we can append the run name or session ID to the `log` command:

```bash
nextflow log <run_name_or_session_ID>
```

For example:

```bash
nextflow log tiny_fermat
```

This will list the working directory for each process involved in the run.

### Task ID

Each task in Nextflow is assigned a unique ID, generated as a 128-bit hash number. This hash is derived from a combination of the taskâ€™s:

- Input values
- Input files
- Command line string
- Container ID
- Conda environment
- Environment modules
- Any executed scripts in the bin directory

## Additional Metadata with the Fields Option

The `log` command in Nextflow also allows for the retrieval of additional metadata. By using the `-f` or `--fields` option followed by a comma-separated list of fields, we can output specific details about each process in the pipeline.

For example:

```bash
nextflow log tiny_fermat -f 'process,exit,hash,duration'
```

This command will output the process name, exit status, hash, and duration of each process for the `tiny_fermat` run to the terminal.

The complete list of available fields can be retrieved with the command:

```bash
nextflow log -l
```

> ```bash
> attempt
> complete
> container
> cpus
> disk
> duration
> env
> error_action
> exit
> hash
> inv_ctxt
> log
> memory
> module
> name
> native_id
> pcpu
> peak_rss
> peak_vmem
> pmem
> process
> queue
> rchar
> read_bytes
> realtime
> rss
> scratch
> script
> start
> status
> stderr
> stdout
> submit
> syscr
> syscw
> tag
> task_id
> time
> vmem
> vol_ctxt
> wchar
> workdir
> write_bytes
> ```

### Script

If we want a log of all the commands executed in the pipeline we can use the script field. It is important to note that the resultant output can not be used to run the pipeline steps.

Filtering

The output from the log command can be very long. We can subset the output using the option -F (filter) specifying the filtering criteria. This will print only those tasks matching a pattern using the syntax ~=/<pattern>/.

For example to filter for process with the name fastqc we would run:

```bash
nextflow log tiny_fermat -F 'process =~ /fastqc/'
```

> ```bash
> /data/.../work/c1/56a36d8f498c99ac6cba31e85b3e0c
> /data/.../work/f7/659c65ef60582d9713252bcfbcc310
> ```

This can be useful to locate specific tasks work directories.

Filter pipeline run log

Use the -F option and a regular expression to filter the for a specific process.

```bash
nextflow log elegant_descartes -f name,hash,process,status -F 'process =~ /multiqc/'
```

## Templates

The -t option allows a template (string or file) to be specified. This makes it possible to create a custom report in any text based format.

For example you could save this markdown snippet to a file:

```
## $name

script:

    $script

exist status: $exit
task status: $status
task folder: $folder
```

Then, the following log command will output a markdown file containing the script, exit status and folder of all executed tasks:

```bash
nextflow log elegant_descartes -t my-template.md > execution-report.md
```

Or, the template file can also be written in HTML.

For example:

```html
<div>
  <h2>${name}</h2>
  <div>
    Script:
    <pre>${script}</pre>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Exit: ${exit}</li>
    <li>Status: ${status}</li>
    <li>Work dir: ${workdir}</li>
    <li>Container: ${container}</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

By saving the above snippet in a file named template.html, you can run the following command:

```bash
nextflow log elegant_descartes -t template.html > provenance.html
```

To view the report open it in a browser.

Generate an HTML run report

Generate an HTML report for a run using the -t option and the template.html file.

```groovy

```

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  
```bash
nextflow log elegant_descartes -t template.html > provenance.html
```
</details>
</details>

> Key Points
>
> - Nextflow can produce a custom execution report with run information using the log command.
> - You can generate a report using the -t option specifying a template file.
