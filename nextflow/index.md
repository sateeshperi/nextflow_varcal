<br>

- Nextflow is a remarkably powerful and versatile workflow language designed for crafting scalable and reproducible scientific workflows.
- It adeptly integrates diverse software packages and environment management systems like Docker, Singularity, and Conda, enabling seamless coupling of existing pipelines written in popular scripting languages such as BASH, R, and Python.
- Nextflow streamlines the deployment and execution of workflows on cloud-based or high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures, enhancing efficiency.
- Supported by nf-core, a community-driven initiative, Nextflow benefits from a curated collection of high-quality analysis pipelines.
